# Introduction

"The perpetrator of a crime will bring something into the crime scene and leave with something from it, 
	and that both can be used as forensic evidence" (The Locard's exchange principle)


"Any attempt to remove evidence or run with it, will in 2 of 3 cases create new evidence. But, hey, don't let that stop you!" (Takeshi Kovacs)

# Story

Mastermind has commited a HEINOUS CRIME!!! 

The Presidents daughter's favorite puppy has been stolen!!! 

Whole country is laughing now! Is there nothing saint or impossible for Him?! 

This must be answered! President requests only the best from the police now!

It's well known that the crime is performed by the Mastermind, 
	yet how he's exactly connected to the crime is higly elusive! 

Police assigns's it's best-of-the-best Investigator on it.. obviously YOU!

Mastermind, obviously, has mixed feeling on this and intends always stay 1 step ahead of the police work 
	by trying to mislead the Investigator by tampering with already existing clues and suspects 
		that lead to Him... if He learns about it, that is!
