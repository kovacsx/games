Problem  statement (Collatz conjecture, known as a "3x + 1 problem"):

f(x) : (x / 2) if (x % 2 == 0) else (x * 3 + 1)

The Collatz conjecture states: This process will eventually reach the number 1, regardless of which positive integer is chosen initially. (Wikipedia)

Thus question is:

1. Does f(x) will return 1 for every x eventually? (ie. halting problem) 

Optional:

2. How to estimate the "time" (ie. total iterations) it takes for an arbitrary number x ("program", represented by N bits) to reach 1. 

3. Is it possible to have O(f(x)) GOOD best/worst estimates for any x that can be represented by N bits? -> Guess, it depends on x and it's "fragmentation" of list and O(N*log(N)) in worst case, O(1) for special (best) cases (Answered already?)

--------

I'm trying to answer the 1st and somewhat 2nd question as well. Maybe third is answered as well, don't know, it's "heuristic" I guess.

Just want to get this "game" out of my head, that's it! 

Thus let's try to reimagine the Collatz conjecture as the "Game of Investigator and the Mastermind"!

Enjoy! :)

Mathematical "explanation":


Let's formalize this as:

I : Investigator
M : Mastermind
- : Clue (0 - in Evidence list)
+ : Suspect (1 - in Evidence list)

Thus for every crime (x) there will be "a trail" of most N Clues/Suspect and it can be written as a following list:

Investigator..{Clues/Suspects}..Mastermind

or short form: "P{+/-}M"


... TBD ...
